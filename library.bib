abstract = {The detection and atmospheric characterization of super-Earths is one of the major frontiers of exoplanetary science. Currently, extensive efforts are underway to detect molecules, particularly H2O, in super-Earth atmospheres. In the present work, we develop a systematic set of strategies to identify and observe potentially H2O-rich super-Earths that provide the best prospects for characterizing their atmospheres using existing instruments. Firstly, we provide analytic prescriptions and discuss factors that need to be taken into account while planning and interpreting observations of super-Earth radii and spectra. We discuss how observations in different spectral bandpasses constrain different atmospheric properties of a super-Earth, including radius and temperature of the planetary surface as well as the mean molecular mass, the chemical composition and thermal profile of the atmosphere. In particular, we caution that radii measured in certain bandpasses can induce biases in the interpretation of the interior compositions. Secondly, we investigate the detectability of H2O-rich super-Earth atmospheres using the HST WFC3 spectrograph as a function of the planetary properties and stellar brightness. We find that highly irradiated super-Earths orbiting bright stars, such as 55 Cancri e, present better candidates for atmospheric characterization compared to cooler planets such as GJ 1214b even if the latter orbit lower-mass stars. Besides being better candidates for both transmission and emission spectroscopy, hotter planets offer higher likelihood of cloud-free atmospheres which aid tremendously in the observation and interpretation of spectra. Finally, we present case studies of two super-Earths, GJ 1214b and 55 Cancri e, using available data and models of their interiors and atmospheres.},

abstract = {The second edition of Solar System Astrophysics: Background Science and the Inner Solar System provides new insights into the burgeoning field of planetary astronomy. As in the first edition, this volume begins with a rigorous treatment of coordinate frames, basic positional astronomy, and the celestial mechanics of two and restricted three body system problems. Perturbations are treated in the same way, with clear step-by-step derivations. Then the Earth's gravitational potential field and the Earth-Moon system are discussed, and the exposition turns to radiation properties with a chapter on the Sun. The exposition of the physical properties of the Moon and the terrestrial planets are greatly expanded, with much new information highlighted on the Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars.All of the material is presented within a framework of historical importance. This book and its sister volume, Solar System Astrophysics: Background Science and the Inner Solar system, are pedagogically well written, providing clearly illustrated explanations, for example, of such topics as the numerical integration of the Adams-Williamson equation, the equations of state in planetary interiors and atmospheres, Maxwell’s equations as applied to planetary ionospheres and magnetospheres, and the physics and chemistry of the Habitable Zone in planetary systems.Together, the volumes form a comprehensive text for any university course that aims to deal with all aspects of solar and extra-solar planetary systems. They will appeal separately to the intellectually curious who would like to know how just how far our knowledge of the solar system has progressed in recent years.},

abstract = {The study presented here sought to determine the PVT properties of Ice VII at elevated temperatures and pressures up to 60 GPa using a Mao-Bell type diamond anvil cell with an external Mo-wire resistance heater. The unit cells of Ice VII and gold were monitored during the experiment with gold being used as an internal pressure calibrant. Additionally, the melting curve of Ice VII was determined to greater than 40 GPa by using the disappearance of the diffraction pattern of Ice VII to monitor melting in the system. The melting curve for Ice VII from 3 to 60 GPa was found to be accurately related by a Simon equation: (P−2.17)0.764= T3554.32−1 where pressure and temperature are denoted by P (GPa) and T (kelvin), respectively. These results were used further to constrain the PVT properties of fluid H2O at elevated pressures and temperatures by taking the pressure derivative of the Gibbs free energy difference between Ice VII and fluid H2O along the Ice VII melting curve. Comparison of these results suggests that the previously stated equations of state of fluid H2O overestimate the molar volume of fluid H2O at pressures greater than 20 GPa. Although the data presented in this study is not enough to provide an independent EOS for fluid H2O, future work should take account of our data.},

abstract = {We show that, for a low-mass planet that orbits its host star within several tenths of an AU (like the majority of the Kepler planets), the atmosphere it was able to accumulate while embedded in the proto-planetary disk may not survive unscathed after the disk disperses. This gas envelope, if more massive than a few percent of the core (with a mass below {\$}10 M{\_}\backslashoplus{\$}), has a cooling time that is much longer than the time-scale on which the planet exits the disk. As such, it could not have contracted significantly from its original size, of order the Bondi radius. So a newly exposed proto-planet would be losing mass via a Parker wind that is energized by the stellar continuum radiation. The surface mass-loss induces a mass movement within the envelope that advects internal heat outward. As a result, the planet atmosphere rapidly cools down and contracts, until it has reached a radius of order {\$}0.1{\$} Bondi radius, at which time the mass-loss effectively shuts down. Within a million years after the disk disperses, we find a planet retains only about ten percent of its original envelope, and has a Kelvin-Helmholtz time that is much longer than its actual age. We suggest that this "boil-off" process may be responsible for the lack of planets above a radius of {\$}2.5 R{\_}\backslashoplus{\$} in the Kepler data.},

@article{Salpeter1967,
abstract = {The correlation energy of the electron gas is treated as a perturbation on the total free energy computed for the zero-temperature Thomas-Fermi-Dirac (TFD) model of a solid. The contribution to the free energy is computed on the basis of two extreme assumptions: (i) The correlation energy is considered to be a local function of position inside the Wigner-Seitz sphere; and (ii) correlation forces are sufficiently long range so that the correlation part of the free energy is determined only by the average electron density. It is argued that (ii) is the more valid approach in the region of normal metallic densities. In terms of the parameter sa0, the radius of a sphere occupied by a single electron, an interpolation formula is developed for the correlation energy in the intermediate region between s≪1 (degenerate electron gas) and s∼60 (electron lattice-fluid phase transition). At extremely high densities, a series expansion in s is used to obtain an analytic expression for the electron pressure up to terms of order s3. For these high densities, prescriptions (i) and (ii) are equivalent. At lower densities, numerical results are presented for an assortment of elements for the TFD model, and TFD with correlations based on (i) and (ii). These are compared with shock-wave and seismic data, and the average correlation contribution computed from (ii) is found to be in better agreement than the other two procedures. A semiempirical formula is presented, which fits the numerical data to better than 0.5{\%} for all pressures and atomic numbers, and reduces to the correct expression in the high-density limit. From this semiempirical formula, pressure-density curves are obtained for a variety of elements and minerals which have been considered as likely constituents of the core and mantle of the earth. A table of effective atomic numbers, to be used in the semiempirical formula, is given for the minerals.},

@article{Fortney2007,
abstract = {To aid in the physical interpretation of planetary radii constrained through observations of transiting planets, or eventually direct detections, we compute model radii of pure hydrogen-helium, water, rock, and iron planets, along with various mixtures. Masses ranging from 0.01 Earth masses to 10 Jupiter masses at orbital distances of 0.02-10 AU are considered. For hydrogen-helium rich planets, our models are the first to couple planetary evolution to stellar irradiation over a wide range of orbital separations (0.02-10 AU) through a nongray radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model. Stellar irradiation retards the contraction of giant planets, but its effect is not a simple function of the irradiation level: a planet at 1 AU contracts as slowly as a planet at 0.1 AU. We confirm the assertion of Guillot that very old giant planets under modest stellar irradiation (like that received by Jupiter and Saturn) develop isothermal atmospheric radiative zones once the planet's intrinsic flux drops to a small fraction of the incident flux. For hydrogen-helium planets, we consider cores up to 90{\%} of the total planet mass, comparable to those of Uranus and Neptune. If ``hot Neptunes'' have maintained their original masses and are not remnants of more massive planets, radii of {\~{}}0.30-0.45 RJ are expected. Water planets are {\~{}}40{\%}-50{\%} larger than rocky planets, independent of mass. Finally, we provide tables of planetary radii at various ages and compositions, and for ice-rock-iron planets we fit our results to analytic functions, which will allow for quick composition estimates, given masses and radii, or mass estimates, given only planetary radii. These results will assist in the interpretation of observations for both the current transiting planet surveys as well as upcoming space missions, including COROT and Kepler.},

abstract = {The field of extrasolar planets has rapidly expanded to include the detection of planets with masses smaller than that of Uranus. Many of these are expected to have little or no hydrogen and helium gas, and we might find Earth analogs among them. In this paper we describe our detailed interior models for a rich variety of such massive terrestrial and ocean planets in the 1-10 M⊕ range (super-Earths). The grid presented here allows the characterization of the bulk composition of super-Earths detected in transit and with a measured mass. We show that, on average, planet radius measurements to better than 5{\%}, combined with mass measurements to better than 10{\%}, would permit us to distinguish between an icy or rocky composition. This is due to the fact that there is a maximum radius a rocky terrestrial planet may achieve for a given mass. Any value of the radius above this maximum terrestrial radius implies that the planet contains a large (>10{\%}) amount of water (ocean planet).},

This model is the first to be applicable to all H(2)O phases in these wide ranges, which exceed the stability domain of all phases. Developing empirical or semiempirical expressions for the specific volumes of liquid water or ices has been necessary. The model has been tested on available experimental data sets. The specific volume of liquid water is reproduced with an accuracy better than 1{\%}. The error on the specific volume of ices remains within 2{\%}. The model has also been used to describe the melting curves of high-pressure ice polymorphs and compared with new Simon equations fitting available data. Our calculations suggest a slight revision of the triple point positions in the H(2)O phase diagram. We have ensured the reliability of our model up to 1.5 GPa, and we have shown that it can be used with good confidence up to 2.2 GPa. In order to show the validity of this model in the low-temperature domains, the melting curve of ice Ih in the water-ammonia system has been modeled. This curve is reproduced with good accuracy down to 180 K, at a 1 bar pressure. It shows that this model can be used in further studies for modeling equilibriums involving liquid or solid phases of H(2)O under pressure and for investigating the effect of inhibitors in complex water-rich systems.},

We apply these perturbations to the Earth, the planet we know best. Using the mineral physics toolkit BurnMan to self-consistently calculate mass-radius models, we find that core radius, presence of light elements in the core and an upper-mantle consisting of low-pressure silicates have the largest effect on the final calculated mass at a given radius, with mantle composition being secondary. We further apply this model to determine the interior composition of Kepler-36b, finding that it is likely structurally similar to the Earth with Si/Fe = 1.14 compared to Earth's Si/Fe = 1 and Sun's Si/Fe = 1.19.

abstract = {The planet GJ 1214b is the second known super-Earth with a measured mass and radius. Orbiting a quiet M star, it receives considerably less mass-loss driving X-ray and UV radiation than CoRoT-7b, so that the interior may be quite dissimilar in composition, including the possibility of a large fraction of water. We model the interior of GJ 1214b assuming a two-layer (envelope+rock core) structure where the envelope material is either H/He, pure water, or a mixture of H/He and H2O. Within this framework, we perform models of the thermal evolution and contraction of the planet. We discuss possible compositions that are consistent with Mp = 6.55 M ⊕, Rp = 2.678 R ⊕, an age $\tau$ = 3-10 Gyr, and the irradiation level of the atmosphere. These conditions require that if water exists in the interior, it must remain in a fluid state, with important consequences for magnetic field generation. These conditions also require the atmosphere to have a deep isothermal region extending down to 80-800 bar, depending on composition. Our results bolster the suggestion of a metal-enriched H/He atmosphere for the planet, as we find water-world models that lack an H/He atmosphere to require an implausibly large water-to-rock ratio of more than 6:1. We instead favor an H/He/H2O envelope with high water mass fraction ({\~{}}0.5-0.85), similar to recent models of the deep envelope of Uranus and Neptune. Even with these high water mass fractions in the H/He envelope, generally the bulk composition of the planet can have subsolar water:rock ratios. Dry, water-enriched, and pure water envelope models differ to an observationally significant level in their tidal Love numbers k 2 of, respectively, {\~{}}0.018, {\~{}}0.15, and {\~{}}0.7.},

The influence of LM-REOS on the structure of Jupiter is investigated and compared with state-of-the-art results within a standard three-layer model consistent with astrophysical observations of Jupiter.

abstract = {We present models of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus which exactly match recent accurate determinations of these planets' gravitational harmonics. The models are computed to third order in the rotational disturbance to the total potential and are based upon a method for inverting the gravitational data. For Jupiter and Saturn, a range of gravity models is calculated to test the possibility of a reduction of density in the outer layers due to helium depletion. The results, which are based upon an improved equation of state for molecular hydrogen, indicate that major helium depletion has not occurred in the outer (molecular hydrogen) layers of Jupiter or Saturn, or if it has, that its effect on the density profile is masked by the presence of other, denser, components. Jupiter is found to be slightly enhanced in heavy elements with respect to solar composition, but the density profile of its hydrogen-rich layers generally agrees rather well with a theoretical profile for solar composition. The deviations from such a profile are more pronounced in the case of Saturn. Uranus models have considerable uncertainty; one successful model resembles the ice-rich model of M. Podolak and R.T. Reynolds (1987, Icarus 70, 31–36), but is fitted to a newer value of J4. Our Uranus model has a substantial enrichment of heavy elements at depth, but little separation of the ice from the rock component. All of the Jovian planets appear to have central cores of non-hydrogen-helium material which are of similar mass (about 10–15 Earth masses). For Jupiter and Saturn, our calculations yield a gravitational harmonic J6 which is in agreement with observation, but suggest that this quantity, along with harmonics of higher degree and order, is likely to be more useful for constraining the nature of fluid currents in outer layers rather than deep static structure.},

abstract = {Several transiting super-Earths are expected to be discovered in the coming few years. While tools to model the interior structure of transiting planets exist, inferences about the composition are fraught with ambiguities. We present a framework to quantify how much we can robustly infer about super-Earth and Neptune-size exoplanet interiors from radius and mass measurements. We introduce quaternary diagrams to illustrate the range of possible interior compositions for planets with four layers (iron core, silicate mantles, water layers, and H/He envelopes). We apply our model to CoRoT-7b, GJ 436b, and HAT-P-11b. Interpretation of planets with H/He envelopes is limited by the model uncertainty in the interior temperature, while for CoRoT-7b observational uncertainties dominate. We further find that our planet interior model sharpens the observational constraints on CoRoT-7b's mass and radius, assuming the planet does not contain significant amounts of water or gas. We show that the strength of the limits that can be placed on a super-Earth's composition depends on the planet's density; for similar observational uncertainties, high-density super-Mercuries allow the tightest composition constraints. Finally, we describe how techniques from Bayesian statistics can be used to take into account in a formal way the combined contributions of both theoretical and observational uncertainties to ambiguities in a planet's interior composition. On the whole, with only a mass and radius measurement an exact interior composition cannot be inferred for an exoplanet because the problem is highly underconstrained. Detailed quantitative ranges of plausible compositions, however, can be found.},

abstract = {The interior of giant planets can give valuable information on formation and evolution processes of planetary systems. However, the interior and evolution of Uranus and Neptune is still largely unknown. In this paper, we compare water-rich three-layer structure models of these planets with predictions of shell structures derived from magnetic field models. Uranus and Neptune have unusual non-dipolar magnetic fields contrary to that of the Earth. Extensive three-dimensional simulations of Stanley and Bloxham (Stanley, S., Bloxham, J. [2004]. Nature 428, 151–153) have indicated that such a magnetic field is generated in a rather thin shell of at most 0.3 planetary radii located below the H/He rich outer envelope and a conducting core that is fluid but stably stratified. Interior models rely on equation of state data for the planetary materials which have usually considerable uncertainties in the high-pressure domain. We present interior models for Uranus and Neptune that are based on ab initio equation of state data for hydrogen, helium, and water as the representative of all heavier elements or ices. Based on a detailed high-pressure phase diagram of water we can specify the region where superionic water should occur in the inner envelope. This superionic region correlates well with the location of the stably-stratified region as found in the dynamo models. Hence we suggest a significant impact of the phase diagram of water on the generation of the magnetic fields in Uranus and Neptune.},

TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its two-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical CCD cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with I<13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from one month to one year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10-100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every four months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.},

It serves as a fundamental equation from which additional properties are obtained as partial derivatives by thermodynamic rules. Extending previously developed Gibbs functions, it covers the entire existence region of ice Ih in the T-p diagram. Close to zero temperature, it obeys the theoretical cubic limiting law of Debye for heat capacity and Pauling’s residual entropy. It is based on a significantly enlarged experimental data set compared to its predecessors. Due to the inherent thermodynamic cross relations, the formulas for particular quantities like density, thermal expansion, or compressibility are thus fully consistent with each other, are more reliable now, and extended in their ranges of validity. In conjunction with the IAPWS-95 formulation for the fluid phases of water, the new chemical potential of ice allows an alternative computation of the melting and sublimation curves, being improved especially near the triple point, and valid down to 130 K sublimation temperature. It provides an absolute entropy reference value for liquid water at the triple point.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the bulk composition of the MEarth transiting super-Earth exoplanet GJ 1214b using planet interior structure models. We consider three possible origins for the gas layer on GJ 1214b: direct accretion of gas from the protoplanetary nebula, sublimation of ices, and outgassing from rocky material. Armed only with measurements of the planet mass (Mp = 6.55 ± 0.98 M ⊕), radius (Rp = 2.678 ± 0.13 R ⊕), and stellar irradiation level, our main conclusion is that we cannot infer a unique composition. A diverse range of planet interiors fits the measured planet properties. Nonetheless, GJ 1214b's relatively low average density ($\rho$ p = 1870 ± 400 kg m-3) means that it almost certainly has a significant gas component. Our second major conclusion is that under most conditions we consider GJ 1214b would not have liquid water. Even if the outer envelope is predominantly sublimated water ice, the envelope will likely consist of a super-fluid layer sandwiched between vapor above and plasma (electrically conductive fluid) below at greater depths. In our models, a low intrinsic planet luminosity (lsim2TW) is needed for a water envelope on GJ 1214b to pass through the liquid phase.},

Different regions of the mass-radius phase space are also identified to correspond to different planet structures. In general, super-Earth-size planets (isolated or without significant parent star irradiation effects) older than about 3 Gyr would be mostly solid.},

abstract = {Many exoplanets have been discovered with radii of 1-4 Earth radii, between that of Earth and Neptune. A number of these are known to have densities consistent with solid compositions, while others are "sub-Neptunes" likely to have significant hydrogen-helium envelopes. Future surveys will no doubt significantly expand these populations. In order to understand how the measured masses and radii of such planets can inform their structures and compositions, we construct models both for solid layered planets and for planets with solid cores and gaseous envelopes, exploring a range of core masses, hydrogen-helium envelope masses, and associated envelope entropies. For planets in the super-Earth/sub-Neptune regime for which both radius and mass are measured, we estimate how each is partitioned into a solid core and gaseous envelope, associating a specific core mass and envelope mass with a given exoplanet. We perform this decomposition for both "Earth-like" rock-iron cores and pure ice cores, and find that the necessary gaseous envelope masses for this important sub-class of exoplanets must range very widely from zero to many Earth masses, even for a given core mass. This result bears importantly on exoplanet formation and envelope evaporation processes.},

@article{Wagner2011,
abstract = {The detection of low-mass extrasolar planets has initiated growing interest in massive rocky bodies (super-Earths) for which no Solar System analogue does exist. Here, we present a new model approach to investigate their interior structure and thermal state. We improve and extend previous interior models mainly in two areas: the first improvement is due to the consequent application of equations of state (EoS) that are compliant with the thermodynamics of the high-pressure limit and facilitate reinvestigating mass–radius relations for terrestrial-type exoplanets. To quantify the uncertainty due to extrapolation, we compare a generalized Rydberg and a Keane EoS, which are both consistent with the high-pressure limit. Furthermore, we consider a reciprocal K′ EoS that fits the seismologically obtained Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM), thereby accounting for the mineralogical composition of the Earth. As a result, the predicted planetary radii of terrestrial-type exoplanets of up to 10 Earth masses would differ by less than 2{\%} between all three EoS, well within current observational limits. The second extension arises from the adoption of a mixing length formulation instead of the commonly used, more simplified parameterized approach to model convective heat transport in planetary mantles. In comparison to parameterized convection models, our results indicate generally hotter interiors with increasing planetary mass and a cumulative tendency to extended regimes of sluggish convection in the lowermost mantle. The latter is attributed to less efficient convective heat transport with increasing mantle pressures. An improved knowledge of the present thermal state is prerequisite to gain a better understanding of the pathways of internal evolution of terrestrial-type exoplanets.},

abstract = {In 1995, the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS) adopted a new formulation called “The IAPWS Formulation 1995 for the Thermodynamic Properties of Ordinary Water Substance for General and Scientific Use”, which we abbreviate to IAPWS-95 formulation or IAPWS-95 for short. This IAPWS-95 formulation replaces the previous formulation adopted in 1984. This work provides information on the selected experimental data of the thermodynamic properties of water used to develop the new formulation, but information is also given on newer data. The article presents all details of the IAPWS-95 formulation, which is in the form of a fundamental equation explicit in the Helmholtz free energy. The function for the residual part of the Helmholtz free energy was fitted to selected data for the following properties: (a) thermal properties of the single-phase region (p$\rho$T) and of the vapor–liquid phase boundary (p $\sigma$ $\rho$ ′ $\rho$ ″ T), including the phase-equilibrium condition (Maxwell criterion), and (b) the caloric properties specific isochoric heat capacity, specific isobaric heat capacity,speed of sound, differences in the specific enthalpy and in the specific internal energy, Joule–Thomson coefficient, and isothermal throttling coefficient. By applying modern strategies for optimizing the functional form of the equation of state and for the simultaneous nonlinear fitting to the data of all mentioned properties, the resulting IAPWS-95 formulation covers a validity range for temperatures from the melting line (lowest temperature 251.2 K at 209.9 MPa) to 1273 K and pressures up to 1000 MPa. In this entire range of validity, IAPWS-95 represents even the most accurate data to within their experimental uncertainty. In the most important part of the liquid region, the estimated uncertainty of IAPWS-95 ranges from ±0.001{\%} to ±0.02{\%} in density, ±0.03{\%} to ±0.2{\%} in speed of sound, and ±0.1{\%} in isobaric heat capacity. In the liquid region at ambient pressure, IAPWS-95 is extremely accurate in density (uncertainty ⩽±0.0001{\%}) and in speed of sound (±0.005{\%}). In a large part of the gas region the estimated uncertainty in density ranges from ±0.03{\%} to ±0.05{\%}, in speed of sound it amounts to ±0.15{\%} and in isobaric heat capacity it is ±0.2{\%}. In the critical region, IAPWS-95 represents not only the thermal properties very well but also the caloric properties in a reasonable way. Special interest has been focused on the extrapolation behavior of the new formulation. At least for the basic properties such as pressure and enthalpy, IAPWS-95 can be extrapolated up to extremely high pressures and temperatures. In addition to the IAPWS-95 formulation, independent equations for vapor pressure, the densities, and the most important caloric properties along the vapor–liquid phase boundary, and for the pressure on the melting and sublimation curve, are given. Moreover, a so-called gas equation for densities up to 55 kg   m −3 is also included. Tables of the thermodynamic properties calculated from the IAPWS-95 formulation are listed in the Appendix.},

abstract = {GJ 1214b stands out among the detected low-mass exoplanets, because it is, so far, the only one amenable to transmission spectroscopy. Up to date there is no consensus about the composition of its envelope although most studies suggest a high molecular weight atmosphere. In particular, it is unclear if hydrogen and helium are present or if the atmosphere is water dominated. Here, we present results on the composition of the envelope obtained by using an internal structure and evolutionary model to fit the mass and radius data. By examining all possible mixtures of water and H/He, with the corresponding opacities, we find that the bulk amount of H/He of GJ 1214b is at most 7{\%} by mass. In general, we find the radius of warm sub-Neptunes to be most sensitive to the amount of H/He. We note that all (Kepler-11b,c,d,f, Kepler-18b, Kepler-20b, 55Cnc-e, Kepler-36c, and Kepler-68b) but two (Kepler-11e and Kepler-30b) of the discovered low-mass planets so far have less than 10{\%} H/He. In fact, Kepler-11e and Kepler-30b have 10{\%}-18{\%} and 5{\%}-15{\%} bulk H/He. Conversely, little can be determined about the H2O or rocky content of sub-Neptune planets. We find that although a 100{\%} water composition fits the data for GJ 1214b, based on formation constraints the presence of heavier refractory material on this planet is expected, and hence, so is a component lighter than water required. The same is true for Kepler-11f. A robust determination by transmission spectroscopy of the composition of the upper atmosphere of GJ 1214b will help determine the extent of compositional segregation between the atmosphere and the envelope.},

abstract = {The Kepler Mission, combined with ground based radial velocity follow-up and dynamical analyses of transit timing variations, has revolutionized the observational constraints on sub-Neptune-size planet compositions. The results of an extensive Kepler follow-up program including multiple Doppler measurements for 22 planet-hosting stars (Marcy et al. 2014) more than doubles the population of sub-Neptune-sized transiting planets that have radial velocity mass constraints. This unprecedentedly large and homogeneous sample of planets with both mass and radius constraints opens the possibility of a statistical study of the underlying population of planet compositions. We focus on the intriguing transition between rocky exoplanets (comprised of iron and silicates) and planets with voluminous layers of volatiles (H/He and astrophysical ices). Applying a hierarchical bayesian statistical approach to the sample of Kepler transiting sub-Neptune planets with Keck radial velocity follow-up, we constrain the fraction of close-in planets (with orbital periods less than {\~{}}50 days) that are sufficiently dense to be rocky, as a function of planet radius. We show that the majority of 1.6 Earth-radius planets are too low density to be comprised of Fe and silicates alone. At larger radii, the constraints on the fraction of rocky planets are even more stringent. These insights into the size demographics of rocky and volatile-rich planets offer empirical constraints to planet formation theories, and guide the range of planet radii to be considered in studies of the occurrence rate of "Earth-like" planets, {\$}\backslasheta{\_}{\{}Earth{\}}{\$}.},

abstract = {PLATO 2.0 has recently been selected for ESA's M3 launch opportunity (2022/24). Providing accurate key planet parameters (radius, mass, density and age) in statistical numbers, it addresses fundamental questions such as: How do planetary systems form and evolve? Are there other systems with planets like ours, including potentially habitable planets? The PLATO 2.0 instrument consists of 34 small aperture telescopes (32 with 25 sec readout cadence and 2 with 2.5 sec candence) providing a wide field-of-view (2232 deg2) and a large photometric magnitude range (4-16 mag). It focusses on bright (4-11 mag) stars in wide fields to detect and characterize planets down to Earth-size by photometric transits, whose masses can then be determined by ground-based radial-velocity follow-up measurements. Asteroseismology will be performed for these bright stars to obtain highly accurate stellar parameters, including masses and ages. The combination of bright targets and asteroseismology results in high accuracy for the bulk planet parameters: 2{\%}, 4-10{\%} and 10{\%} for planet radii, masses and ages, respectively. The planned baseline observing strategy includes two long pointings (2-3 years) to detect and bulk characterize planets reaching into the habitable zone (HZ) of solar-like stars and an additional step-and-stare phase to cover in total about 50{\%} of the sky. PLATO 2.0 will observe up to 1,000,000 stars and detect and characterize hundreds of small planets, and thousands of planets in the Neptune to gas giant regime out to the HZ. It will therefore provide the first large-scale catalogue of bulk characterized planets with accurate radii, masses, mean densities and ages. This catalogue will include terrestrial planets at intermediate orbital distances, where surface temperatures are moderate. Coverage of this parameter range with statistical numbers of bulk characterized planets is unique to PLATO 2.0.},

abstract = {Until recently, infrared observations of exoplanetary atmospheres have typically been interpreted using models that assumed solar elemental abundances. With the chemical composition fixed, attempts have been made to classify hot Jupiter atmospheres on the basis of stellar irradiation. However, recent observations have revealed deviations from predictions based on such classification schemes, and chemical compositions retrieved from some data sets have also indicated non-solar abundances. The data require a two-dimensional (2D) characterization scheme with dependence on both irradiation and chemistry. In this work, we suggest the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio as an important second dimension for characterizing exoplanetary atmospheres. In hot-hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, the C/O ratio critically influences the relative concentrations of several spectroscopically dominant species. Between a C/O of 0.5 (solar value) and 2, the H2O and CH4 abundances can vary by several orders of magnitude in the observable atmosphere, and new hydrocarbon species such as HCN and C2H2 become prominent for C/O {\&}gt;= 1, while the CO abundance remains almost unchanged. Furthermore, a C/O {\&}gt;= 1 can preclude a strong thermal inversion due to TiO and VO in a hot Jupiter atmosphere, since TiO and VO are naturally underabundant for C/O {\&}gt;= 1. We, therefore, suggest a new 2D classification scheme for hydrogen-dominated exoplanetary atmospheres with irradiation (or temperature) and C/O ratio as the two dimensions. We define four classes in this 2D space (O1, O2, C1, and C2) with distinct chemical, thermal, and spectral properties. Based on the most recent observations, we characterize the thermal structure and C/O ratios of six hot Jupiters (XO-1b, CoRoT-2b, WASP-14b, WASP-19b, WASP-33b, and WASP-12b) in the framework of our proposed 2D classification scheme. While the data for several systems in our sample are consistent with C-rich atmospheres, new observations are required to conclusively constrain their C/O ratios in the day side as well as the terminator regions of their atmospheres. We discuss how observations using existing and forthcoming facilities can constrain C/O ratios in exoplanetary atmospheres.},

By Gibbs free energy calculations we find that for pressures between 10 and 40 Mbar the ice-hydrogen interface is thermodynamically unstable at temperatures above approximately 3000 K, far below the temperature of the core-mantle boundaries in Jupiter and Saturn.

abstract = {We use models of thermal evolution and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) driven mass loss to explore the composition and history of low-mass, low-density transiting planets. We investigate the Kepler-11 system in detail and provide estimates of both the current and past planetary compositions. We find that an H/He envelope on Kepler-11b is highly vulnerable to mass loss. By comparing to formation models, we show that in situ formation of the system is extremely difficult. Instead we propose that it is a water-rich system of sub-Neptunes that migrated from beyond the snow line. For the broader population of observed planets, we show that there is a threshold in bulk planet density and incident flux above which no low-mass transiting planets have been observed. We suggest that this threshold is due to the instability of H/He envelopes to XUV-driven mass loss. Importantly, we find that this mass-loss threshold is well reproduced by our thermal evolution/contraction models that incorporate a standard mass-loss prescription. Treating the planets' contraction history is essential because the planets have significantly larger radii during the early era of high XUV fluxes. Over time low-mass planets with H/He envelopes can be transformed into water-dominated worlds with steam envelopes or rocky super-Earths. Finally, we use this threshold to provide likely minimum masses and radial-velocity amplitudes for the general population of Kepler candidates. Likewise, we use this threshold to provide constraints on the maximum radii of low-mass planets found by radial-velocity surveys.},

abstract = {Insights into a distant exoplanet's interior are possible given a synergy between models and observations. Spectral observations of a star's radial velocity wobble induced by an orbiting planet's gravitational pull measure the planet mass. Photometric transit observations of a planet crossing the disk of its star measure the planet radius. This thesis interprets the measured masses and radii of super-Earth and sub-Neptune exoplanets, employing models to constrain the planets' bulk compositions, formation histories, and habitability. We develop a model for the internal structure of low-mass exoplanets consisting of up to four layers: an iron core, silicate mantle, ice layer, and gas layer. We quantify the span of plausible bulk compositions for low-mass transiting planets CoRoT-7b, GJ 436b, and HAT-P-11b, and describe how Bayesian analysis can be applied to rigorously account for observational, model, and inherent uncertainties. We present a detailed case study of GJ 1214b, the first exemplar of a new class of volatile-rich super-Earth exoplanets. At 6.5 M and 2.7 R, GJ 1214b must have a gas layer to account for its low mean density. We present three possible scenarios for the origin of the gas layer on GJ 1214b: direct accretion of H/He gas from the protoplanetary nebula, sublimation of ices, and outgassing of volatiles from a rocky interior. We next explore the low-density extreme of the mass-radius relations for volatile- rich super-Earth exoplanets. Using models of planet formation, structure, and survival, we constrain the minimum plausible planet mass for a measured planet radius and equi- librium temperature. We explore both core-nucleated accretion and outgassing as two separate formation pathways for Neptune-size planets with voluminous atmospheres of light gases. Finally, we present a practical method to assess whether a hydrogen-rich sub- Neptune planet with measured mass and radius could potentially harbor a liquid water ocean. Using a one-dimensional radiative-convective model of energy transport through water-saturated hydrogen-rich envelopes, we constrain the combinations of planet properties (mass, radius, equilibrium temperature, intrinsic luminosity) that 3 are conducive to liquid water oceans. The pace of low-mass exoplanet discoveries is poised to accelerate, and this thesis will contribute to constraining the interior properties of newfound planets.},

abstract = {Interior models of Jupiter and Saturn are calculated and compared in the framework of the three-layer assumption, which rely on the perception that both planets consist of three globally homogeneous regions: a dense core, a metallic hydrogen envelope, and a molecular hydrogen envelope. Within this framework, constraints on the core mass and abundance of heavy elements (i.e. elements other than hydrogen and helium) are given by accounting for uncertainties on the measured gravitational moments, surface temperature, surface helium abundance, and on the inferred protosolar helium abundance, equations of state, temperature profile and solid/differential interior rotation. Results obtained solely from static models matching the measured gravitational fields indicate that the mass of Jupiter’s dense core is less than 14 M⊕ (Earth masses), but that models with no core are possible given the current uncertainties on the hydrogen–helium equation of state. Similarly, Saturn’s core mass is less than 22 M⊕ but no lower limit can be inferred. The total mass of heavy elements (including that in the core) is constrained to lie between 11 and 42 M⊕ in Jupiter, and between 19 and 31 M⊕ in Saturn. The enrichment in heavy elements of their molecular envelopes is 1–6.5, and 0.5–12 times the solar value, respectively. Additional constraints from evolution models accounting for the progressive differentiation of helium (Hubbard WB, Guillot T, Marley MS, Burrows A, Lunine JI, Saumon D, 1999. Comparative evolution of Jupiter and Saturn. Planet. Space Sci. 47, 1175–1182) are used to obtain tighter, albeit less robust, constraints. The resulting core masses are then expected to be in the range 0–10 M⊕, and 6–17 M⊕ for Jupiter and Saturn, respectively. Furthermore, it is shown that Saturn’s atmospheric helium mass mixing ratio, as derived from Voyager, Y=0.06±0.05, is probably too low. Static and evolution models favor a value of Y=0.11−0.25. Using, Y=0.16±0.05, Saturn’s molecular region is found to be enriched in heavy elements by 3.5 to 10 times the solar value, in relatively good agreement with the measured methane abundance. Finally, in all cases, the gravitational moment J6 of models matching all the constraints are found to lie between 0.35 and 0.38×10−4 for Jupiter, and between 0.90 and 0.98×10−4 for Saturn, assuming solid rotation. For comparison, the uncertainties on the measured J6 are about 10 times larger. More accurate measurements of J6 (as expected from the Cassini orbiter for Saturn) will therefore permit to test the validity of interior models calculations and the magnitude of differential rotation in the planetary interior.},

Among these is the mode of convection, which influences a planet's thermal evolution and surface conditions. On Earth, plate tectonics has been proposed as a necessary condition for life. Here we show that super-Earths will also have plate tectonics. We demonstrate that as planetary mass increases, the shear stress available to overcome resistance to plate motion increases while the plate thickness decreases, thereby enhancing plate weakness. These effects contribute favorably to the subduction of the lithosphere, an essential component of plate tectonics. Moreover, uncertainties in achieving plate tectonics in the 1 M⊕ regime disappear as mass increases: super-Earths, even if dry, will exhibit plate tectonic behavior.},

The use of this universal relation to estimate pressure-volume relations (i.e., isotherms) required three input parameters at each fixed temperature. In this paper we show that for many solids the input data needed to predict high-temperature thermodynamical properties can be dramatically reduced. In particular, only four numbers are needed: (1) the zero pressure (P=0) isothermal bulk modulus, (2) its P=0 pressure derivative, (3) the P=0 volume, and (4) the P=0 thermal expansion; all evaluated at a single (reference) temperature. Explicit predictions are made for the high-temperature isotherms, the thermal expansion as a function of temperature, and the temperature variation of the isothermal bulk modulus and its pressure derivative. These predictions are tested using experimental data for three representative solids: gold, sodium chloride, and xenon. Good agreement between theory and experiment is found.},

This functional form arises because the common building blocks of solid planets all have equations of state that are well approximated by a modified polytrope of the form $\rho$=$\rho$0+cPn.

abstract = {By comparison with the Earth-like planets and the large icy satellites of the Solar System, one can model the internal structure of extrasolar planets. The input parameters are the composition of the star (Fe/Si and Mg/Si), the Mg content of the mantle (Mg{\#} = Mg/[Mg + Fe]), the amount of H 2O and the total mass of the planet. Equation of State (EoS) of the different materials that are likely to be present within such planets have been obtained thanks to recent progress in high-pressure experiments. They are used to compute the planetary radius as a function of the total mass. Based on accretion models and data on planetary differentiation, the internal structure is likely to consist of an iron-rich core, a silicate mantle and an outer silicate crust resulting from magma formation in the mantle. The amount of H 2O and the surface temperature control the possibility for these planets to harbor an ocean. In preparation to the interpretation of the forthcoming data from the CNES led CoRoT (Convection Rotation and Transit) mission and from ground-based observations, this paper investigates the relationship between radius and mass. If H 2O is not an important component (less than 0.1{\%}) of the total mass of the planet, then a relation (R/R)=a( is calculated with (a,b)=(1,0.306) and (a,b)=(1,0.274) for 10M<M<M and M<M<10M, respectively. Calculations for a planet that contains 50{\%} H 2O suggest that the radius would be more than 25{\%} larger than that based on the Earth-like model, with (a,b)=(1.258,0.302) for 10M<M<M and (a,b)=(1.262,0.275) for M<M<10M, respectively. For a surface temperature of 300 K, the thickness of the ocean varies from 150 to 50 km for planets 1 to 10 times the Earth's mass, respectively. Application of this algorithm to bodies of the Solar System provides not only a good fit to most terrestrial planets and large icy satellites, but also insights for discussing future observations of exoplanets.},

abstract = {The research of exoplanets has entered an era in which we characterize extrasolar planets. This has become possible with measurements of radii and luminosities. Meanwhile, radial velocity surveys discover also very low-mass planets. Uniting all this observational data into one coherent picture to better understand planet formation is an important, but difficult undertaking. Our approach is to develop a model which can make testable predictions for all these observational methods. We continue to describe how we have extended our formation model into a self-consistently coupled formation and evolution model. We show how we calculate the internal structure of the solid core and radiogenic heating. We also improve the protoplanetary disk model. Finally, we conduct population synthesis calculations. We present how the planetary mass-radius relationship of planets with primordial H/He envelopes forms and evolves in time. The basic shape of the M-R relation can be understood from the core accretion model. Low-mass planets cannot bind massive envelopes, while super-critical cores necessarily trigger runway gas accretion, leading to "forbidden" zones in the M-R plane. For a given mass, there is a considerable diversity of radii. We compare the synthetic M-R relation with the observed one, finding good agreement for a>0.1 AU. The synthetic radius distribution is characterized by a strong increase towards small R, and a second, lower local maximum at {\~{}}1 Jovian radius. The increase towards small radii reflects the increase of the mass function towards low M. The second local maximum is due to the fact that radii are nearly independent of mass for giant planets. A comparison of the synthetic radius distribution with Kepler data shows agreement for R>2 Earth radii, but divergence for smaller radii. We predict that in the next few years, Kepler should find the second, local maximum at {\~{}}1 Jovian radius.},

@article{Grasset2009,
abstract = {A mass-radius (M-R) relationship is proposed for solid planets and solid cores ranging from 1 to 100 Earth-mass planets. It relies on the assumption that solid spheres are composed of iron and silicates, around which a variable amount of water is added. The M-R law has been set up assuming that the planetary composition is similar to the averaged composition for silicates and iron obtained from the major elements ratio of 94 stars hosting exoplanets. Except on Earth for which a tremendous amount of data is available, the composition of silicate mantles and metallic cores cannot be constrained. Similarly, thermal profiles are poorly known. In this work, the effect of compositional parameters and thermal profiles on radii estimates is quantified. It will be demonstrated that uncertainties related to composition and temperature are secondary compared to the effect of the amount of water. The super-Earth family includes four classes of planets: iron-rich, silicate-rich, water-rich, or with a thick atmosphere. For a given mass, the planetary radius increases significantly from the iron-rich to the atmospheric-rich planet. Even if some overlaps are likely, M-R measurements could be accurate enough to ascertain the discovery of an Earth-like planet. The present work describes how the amount of water can be assessed from M-R measurements. Such an estimate depends on several assumptions including (1) the accuracy of the internal structure model and (2) the accuracy of mass and radius measurements. It is shown that if the mass and the radius are perfectly known, the standard deviation of the amount of water is about 4.5{\%}. This value increases rapidly with the radius uncertainty but does not strongly depend on the mass uncertainty.},

@article{Knudson2012,
abstract = {Recently, there has been a tremendous increase in the number of identified extrasolar planetary systems. Our understanding of their formation is tied to exoplanet internal structure models, which rely upon equations of state of light elements and compounds such as water. Here, we present shock compression data for water with unprecedented accuracy that show that water equations of state commonly used in planetary modeling significantly overestimate the compressibility at conditions relevant to planetary interiors. Furthermore, we show that its behavior at these conditions, including reflectivity and isentropic response, is well-described by a recent first-principles based equation of state. These findings advocate that this water model be used as the standard for modeling Neptune, Uranus, and “hot Neptune” exoplanets and should improve our understanding of these types of planets.},

@article{Levi2014,
abstract = {In this work, we study the transport of methane in the external water envelopes surrounding water-rich super-Earths. We investigate the influence of methane on the thermodynamics and mechanics of the water mantle. We find that including methane in the water matrix introduces a new phase (filled ice), resulting in hotter planetary interiors. This effect renders the super-ionic and reticulating phases accessible to the lower ice mantle of relatively low-mass planets ({\~{}}5 ME ) lacking a H/He atmosphere. We model the thermal and structural profile of the planetary crust and discuss five possible crustal regimes which depend on the surface temperature and heat flux. We demonstrate that the planetary crust can be conductive throughout or partly confined to the dissociation curve of methane clathrate hydrate. The formation of methane clathrate in the subsurface is shown to inhibit the formation of a subterranean ocean. This effect results in increased stresses on the lithosphere, making modes of ice plate tectonics possible. The dynamic character of the tectonic plates is analyzed and the ability of this tectonic mode to cool the planet is estimated. The icy tectonic plates are found to be faster than those on a silicate super-Earth. A mid-layer of low viscosity is found to exist between the lithosphere and the lower mantle. Its existence results in a large difference between ice mantle overturn timescales and resurfacing timescales. Resurfacing timescales are found to be 1 Ma for fast plates and 100 Ma for sluggish plates, depending on the viscosity profile and ice mass fraction. Melting beneath spreading centers is required in order to account for the planetary radiogenic heating. The melt fraction is quantified for the various tectonic solutions explored, ranging from a few percent for the fast and thin plates to total melting of the upwelled material for the thick and sluggish plates. Ice mantle dynamics is found to be important for assessing the composition of the atmosphere. We propose a mechanism for methane release into the atmosphere, where freshly exposed reservoirs of methane clathrate hydrate at the ridge dissociate under surface conditions. We formulate the relation between the outgassing flux and the tectonic mode dynamical characteristics. We give numerical estimates for the global outgassing rate of methane into the atmosphere. We find, for example, that for a 2 ME planet outgassing can release 1027-1029 molecules s–1 of methane to the atmosphere. We suggest a qualitative explanation for how the same outgassing mechanism may result in either a stable or a runaway volatile release, depending on the specifics of a given planet. Finally, we integrate the global outgassing rate for a few cases and quantify how the surface atmospheric pressure of methane evolves over time. We find that methane is likely an important constituent of water planets' atmospheres.},

@article{Ehrenreich2006,
abstract = {Extrasolar planets as light as a few Earth masses are now being detected. Such planets are likely not gas or ice giants. Here, we present a study on the possible properties of the small and cold extrasolar planets, applied to the case of the recently discovered planet OGLE 2005-BLG-390Lb. This planet (5.5 M⊕) orbits 2.6 AU away from an old M-type star of the Galactic bulge. The planet should be entirely frozen given the low surface temperature (35-47 K). However, depending on the rock-to-ice mass ratio in the planet, the radiogenic heating could be sufficient to make the existence of liquid water within an icy crust possible. This possibility is estimated as a function of the planetary mass and the illumination received from the parent star, both being strongly related by the observational constraints. The results are presented for water-poor and water-rich planets. We find that no oceans can be present in any cases at 9-10 Gyr, a typical age for a star of the bulge. However, we find that in the past, when the planet was 5 Gyr old, liquid water was likely present below an icy surface. Nevertheless, the planet is now likely to be entirely frozen.},
